    <p>Pearl was one of the few that started the Crystal Gems. A rebillion regime against the Diamonds in order to save the planet and its inhabitants. Bound to Rose (The leader of the Crystal Gems) by both gem order and Pearls love for her. They fought and barely won against the Diamonds. Since that war Pearl has only shown that the gem order is meaningless and that any gem can be anything they want to be! Pearl continues her life on earth bestowing these values onto other gems including Rose's son Steven. </p>
